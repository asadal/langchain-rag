### hi

Yes. Nice to meet you. I'm Gary. How can I help you?

### I'm unhappy with the article.

I'm sorry you didn't like the article. I am a chatbot for 'friends' of Hankyoreh's sponsored members. If you have any questions about the article, please contact the Hankyoreh customer center at 1566-9595.

### What is a Hankyoreh Supporting Member? What is a Hankyoreh 'Supporters' Friend'?

The Hankyoreh is a "nationalist newspaper" founded in 1988 through public donations. For more than 30 years, Hankyoreh remained a "newspaper sponsored by the people. In 2021, Hankyoreh became a "people's sponsored media" by openly recruiting digital sponsorship members. Instead of remaining completely free and open in the digital space so that anyone can easily access Hankyoreh's articles, the newspaper is now more sustainable through voluntary donations. Sponsorship makes it possible for Hankyoreh to be independent of corporate power, not only in terms of governance but also in terms of revenue. Donations make Hankyoreh journalism more valuable and sustainable. If you want Hankyoreh to remain an indispensable media outlet for our society, please join us as a supporter.

### How can I become a "Supporters's Friend"?

You can proceed with the sponsorship process by clicking the 'Donate' button at the top of the Hankyoreh homepage (https://www.hani.co.kr), online articles, or the Hankyoreh Supporters' Friend homepage. After logging in (if you don't have an ID, you will need to sign up for an account), select a donation method, amount, and payment method, such as a regular donation or a one-time donation, and click the 'Sign up for a donation' button to complete the donation process. Stock sponsorship requires separate procedures such as verifying your identity and checking the Hankyoreh Shareholder Center.

### Are there any benefits (rewards) for being a Hanukkere Supporters' Friend?

Regular supporters and stock supporters will receive a gift of 'Kyori Notebook' with the mascot of Hankyoreh Supporters' Friends, 'Kyori'. We also provide all supporters with exclusive content rewards such as 'Hantam' and special editions of special reports. We also provide a monthly newsletter, 'Hankyo-Letter', discount coupons for brand stores, and various promotions and events.

### I want to make a direct deposit to my account.

Currently, the only way to donate online is by direct deposit. If you send donations directly to your donation account, it will not be reflected in the system and you will not be able to see the donation details on your My Page. Also, it is difficult to provide benefits to donors due to the lack of mobile phone number/email information, so we recommend that you donate online via bank transfer, card, Kakao Pay, Naver Pay, etc.

### I changed my card and want to make a donation to cover the amount I haven't paid in a while.

In addition to recurring donations, there are one-time donations. You can make a one-time donation. To do so, go to the Donate page (https://support.hani.co.kr/hani/support.hani) and select "One-Time Donation".

### Can I take a charitable deduction for my donation on my year-end or comprehensive income tax return?

You cannot receive a donation deduction for donations made as a member of a media sponsor. Hankyoreh Newspaper is a for-profit company like a general company, so donations to Hankyoreh do not count as donations. Donations are only for non-profit organizations, not for general companies or media companies. However, when you file your year-end tax deduction or comprehensive income tax return, it will be counted as the amount of your current card usage.

### Can I change my payment method over the phone?

The Hankyoreh Patron Membership Program takes the protection of your personal information seriously. When you sign up, we collect only the minimum amount of personal information necessary to provide the service, and payment information is entrusted to a payment agency (KG Inisys, Hyosung FMS, Naver, Kakao, etc.). Therefore, we cannot arbitrarily change your payment method (regular, one-time, stock) or payment method (card/account/pay). We apologize for the inconvenience, but please apply for a new regular sponsorship on the sponsorship page (https://support.hani.co.kr).

### I'm a recurring donor, but this month I got a recurring donation payment failure text, my card is expired, and I don't want to receive payment failure texts anymore.

Payment failures are often due to insufficient funds in the account or the card exceeding the authorized amount, expiration, or new (re)issuance. If you have a new card, please cancel your existing patronage and reapply for patronage. If you don't want to receive payment failure text messages anymore, please cancel your patronage.

### How do I change my payment method? I got a new card, how do I change my card/account?

Changing your payment method is a work in progress and will require a new application. If your card has expired, changed cards, etc. and automatic payments are not happening, please submit a new application. We'll check and discontinue your existing support.

### What is Kyori, Supporters' Friend?

Kyori is the friend and mascot of the 'Friends of Hankyoreh', the sponsoring members of Hankyoreh. You may think of it as 'Kyori' of 'Hankyoreh', but it is actually called 'Kyori' with the 'Kyol' in 'YeonKyol'(연결, connection). A plow pulled by two oxen together is also called 'Kyori'. In any case, it's a name that says, 'I love being together, being together'. At first glance, it looks like a bear, but it's actually a mole. His hobby is disguise, and his favorite color is yellow.
